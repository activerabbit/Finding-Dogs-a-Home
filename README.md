### Project: Finding Dogs a Home <br>
1 in 4 animals are euthanized at shelters. This project is an attempt to reduce euthanization of dogs by exploring critical features that contribute to animal outcome and predicting the dogs at risk so that facilities can allocate resources in a systematic and smart fashion to improve the outcome of dogs. This project uses 4 dataset from different shelters around the United States and could be used to develop a smart transferring system for risky dogs that may be adoptable at another shelter. <br>
